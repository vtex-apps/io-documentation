## VTEX IO 

### What can I develop?

With VTEX IO, you can create:

- **Custom Storefront App** - *Build sophisticated, tailor-made React storefront components for your store.* 
- **Custom Admin Apps** - *Unlock and extend VTEX data by creating apps for your store's admin interface*.
- **Custom back-end Apps** - *Speed up connections with Storefront apps or Admin apps by building back-end services that are developed using Node or .NET Core.*
- **Custom Pixel apps** -  *Collect user data for a third-party service of your choosing by creating a pixel app.*
- **Custom mobile Apps** - *Your store website in your customers' mobile device.* 

### Who can use the solution?

VTEX IO is now working as a closed beta, meaning that it's only open to a small group of developers. 

At present, the requisite to enter this closed beta group is to have an *Enterprise* VTEX plan if you are a VTEX account (you can verify the plan account you have in your VTEX contract). 

If you are a partner, you must be a VTEX IO developer certified partner.

### I meet all the necessary prerequisites. What do I need to do to start developing?

If you've met all the necessary conditions to be part of the small group of VTEX IO developers, fill in and submit the  [application form](https://forms.gle/f7bYdTA7tfdfB5tt7) with your project's details to let us know about your interest in order to understand your scenario and provide all the necessary permissions. 

### How much does it cost?

Because it's a closed beta, there is  still *no* extra cost to develop in VTEX IO. 

### What type of support in ensured?

Custom apps are the liability of whoever developed and implemented them, meaning the app's vendor.

Therefore, VTEX shall bear no responsibility with any of these apps, nor provide support for them. 

However, you will be able to benefit from our documentation and always keep yourself up-to-date with the platform's evolution by reading our [Release Notes](https://vtex.io/docs/releases/).

## VTEX IO Store Framework

### What advantages are there to building my store using Store Framework? 

The fastest time-to-market, coupled with the lowest maintenance cost and highest customisable framework. In addition, an accelerated and scalable evolution of your business thanks to a community of developers making every store block  —  and therefore your own store — better every day. 

### Can I customize Store Framework blocks to adapt them to my business needs?

Each Store Framework block has its own properties and CSS Handles that allow it to adapt to your style and behavior. 

This block flexibility was masterminded so that retailers no longer face difficulties when building their brand and identity, helping them decrease store implementation time.  

Therefore, advanced customization that is not on par with natively given customization is not allowed, which means that it's not possible to extend native Store Framework blocks to adapt to your store's needs.

For this type of customization, your VTEX account will need permission to develop its own storefront app using the VTEX IO platform.

### Who can use Store Framework?

Any VTEX store can start using Store Framework since it is an open beta. But bear in mind that due to that status, you can expect a constant state of accelerate evolution. 

### How much does it cost?

The Store Framework solution is already included by default in VTEX contracts, without any additional cost for clients. 

### What type of support is ensured?

All **native** Store Framework blocks benefit from VTEX support, which means that any problem that your store may face with Store Framework blocks can be dealt with by opening a [ticket](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk) and getting in touch with VTEX's Customer Care team.

Because it's an open-source project, Store Framework also grants its users communication channels throughout the community and direct contact with the development team, where you can request new features, improvements, bug fixes or even framework improvement requests.
