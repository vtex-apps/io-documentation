## VTEX IO 

### What can I develop?

With VTEX IO, you can create:

- **Custom Storefront App** - *Build sophisticated, tailor-made React storefront components for your store - works as an open beta.* 
- **Custom Admin Apps** - *Unlock and extend VTEX data by creating apps for your store's admin interface - works as a closed beta.*
- **Custom back-end Apps** - *Speed up connections with Storefront apps or Admin apps by building back-end services that are developed using Node or .NET Core - works as a closed beta.*
- **Custom Pixel apps** -  *Collect user data for a third-party service of your choosing by creating a pixel app - works as a closed beta.*
- **Custom mobile Apps** - *Your store website in your customers' mobile device - works as a closed beta.* 

### Who can use the solution?

For every project type besides Custom Storefront App, VTEX IO works as a closed beta, meaning that it's only open to a small group of developers. 

At present, the requisite to enter this closed beta group is to have an *Enterprise* VTEX plan if you are a VTEX account (you can verify the plan account you have in your VTEX contract). If you are a partner, you must be a VTEX IO developer certified partner.

In case you aim to develop a Custom Storefront App, do not worry about prerequisites: every VTEX account and partner can use the platform to create React projects according to their own business needs.  

### I meet all the necessary prerequisites. What do I need to do to start developing?

If you've met all the necessary conditions to be part of the small group of VTEX IO developers regarding Admin, back-end, pixel and mobile apps, fill in and submit the  [Application form](https://forms.gle/f7bYdTA7tfdfB5tt7) with your project's details to let us know about your interest in order to understand your scenario and provide all the necessary permissions. 

Don't forget to give a good read to the documentation on [filling the Application form for development](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-filling-the-application-form-for-development/).

>ℹ️ Only submit the Application form when developing Admin, back-end, pixel, or mobile apps. Storefront app development no longer requires VTEX authorization i.e., the form submission.

### How much does it cost?

There is still *no* extra cost to develop in VTEX IO.

This block flexibility was masterminded so that retailers no longer face difficulties when building their brand and identity, helping them decrease store implementation time.  

However, advanced customizations are allowed if necessary to create storefront components adapted to specific use cases. But notice: **VTEX does not provide support to custom components developed by third-parties**. Their maintenance, performance, and quality are under the responsibility of the app's vendor.

Any VTEX store can start using Store Framework since it is an open beta. But bear in mind that due to that status, you can expect a constant state of accelerated evolution. 

### How much does it cost?
