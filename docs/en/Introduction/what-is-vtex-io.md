# What is VTEX IO

VTEX IO is an enterprise **low-code development platform** that provides performance management, scalability and safety to your project. 

It gives you the tools to focus on code that really matters for your business instead of needing to deal with infrastructure problems and challenges - that's our job.  

From *web storefronts* to *custom admin apps* and *back-end integrations*: VTEX IO allows you to develop and evolve fast and safe, mainly through: 

## Cloud-native infrastructure 

The VTEX IO platform is battle-tested and **scales automatically** to meet your business demands because infrastructure is taken away from the developer. 

Forget the servers, focus on your sales: our elastic back-end allows you to maintain up-time throughout traffic surges without having to pre-scale or manually prepare.

With nothing to install locally and a command-line application, developers enjoy an unprecedented fast setup time and become productive in record time.

All local changes to code are immediately synced to our cloud development environment and your software is instantly redeployed. "*Works on my machine*" just became a thing of the past. 

## Workspaces

You should be able to deploy changes to code knowing that they will not disrupt your users' experience and will improve your business metrics. 

VTEX IO Workspaces, as the name implies, allow you to do just that by creating **multiple versions of your code**, synchronizing each workspace to our platform and A/B test them.

## Opinionated set of frameworks

Work with familiar and highly productive technologies like TypeScript, React, GraphQL, .NET and Node, using simple and intuitive frameworks which you can learn on-the-go. 

### VTEX IO Store Framework
