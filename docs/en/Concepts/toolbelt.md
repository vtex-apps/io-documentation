# Toolbelt

VTEX Toolbelt is a **command-line interface** that gives you access to every feature of the VTEX platform.

With it you can:
- List, install or uninstall **apps** that are available in your account;
- List, create, promote or remove [**workspaces**](https://vtex.io/docs/concepts/workspaces/);
- Develop new apps in [**link mode**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/linking-an-app/), using automatic synchronization;
- [**Release**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/releasing-a-new-app-version/), [**publish**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/publishing-an-app/) and **deploy** new app versions.

In order to install it and understand more about the command reference, access our article on [**VTEX IO CLI installment and command reference**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/vtex-io-cli-installment-and-command-reference)
