# Making your new app version publicly available

To make your new app version available to end-users, you'll need to take the following steps:

1. [**Release** your app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-releasing-a-new-app-version) - create a release commit and a release tag.
2. [**Publish** a candidate version](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app) - turn the app version into a candidate version by generating an internal build for **testing purposes only**.
3. [**Validate** the candidate version in a **Production workspace**](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app) - validate if any critical problems have gone undetected earlier during development.
4. [**Deploy** the app as a stable version](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-deploying-the-app-stable-version) - update the app version on all accounts with the app installed.
5. [Promote your changes to **Master**](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-promoting-a-workspace-to-master) - make the new app version available to end-users.
