# Design guidelines
 
## Visual consistency
The VTEX brand is expressed in all our products. We are a company that offers first-class solutions for digital and physical commerce globally, and this vision should be reflected in our interface and usability standards.

The visual construction of your app is key to ensure that it will convey the VTEX image similarly to our native features.

All extensions available through the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com) must be consistent with VTEX's graphic standards, our brand colors, and the components of our administrative panel, including blocks, text fields, buttons, titles, navigation, and any other graphic elements displayed.

To ensure your app meets these standards before submitting it for homologation, please refer to our [Brand manual](https://brand.vtex.com/) and the  [VTEX Styleguide](https://styleguide.vtex.com/).

## Clear experience
In addition to adhering to interface consistency standards, it is important to design your app experience to be fluid, simple, and accessible. Apps that are difficult to configure, have confusing guidelines or break the user journey in a critical way will not be approved in our homologation process.

We recommend that you run usability tests with users before submitting your software to VTEX for analysis. You should also map out points of friction and implement solutions to any issues that may have arisen.

### Efficiency of use
User journeys in the application should be linear and complete, indicating a path with a beginning, middle and end.

Always allow the retailer to go back to previous steps when setting up and using your app, and provide clear directions on how to proceed from a certain point.

### System status and feedback
Providing status and feedback on your users' actions is essential to ensure that they understand and successfully complete their journeys.

Make it clear to the retailer when a configuration is incorrect, as well as when it is completed or pending authorization. Clear, simple and actionable messages will ensure that any friction in app configuration is eliminated.

### Avoiding mistakes and errors
Even if your interface is consistent and you have built in clear feedback messages, the user may still have questions or difficulties installing and using your app, especially during their first contact.

Build in mechanisms to prevent unwanted actions such as registry removal, app uninstallation, or resumption of extensive configurations by presenting confirmation messages when the user attempts to perform such actions.

### UX writing principles
In addition to the interface and experience guidelines previously mentioned, it is important that you communicate with our users the same way we communicate with them.

The writing of your app's instructions, actions, feedback and settings should follow our [UX Writing guidelines](https://uxwriting.vtex.com/) just as rigorously as your interface must conform to the [VTEX Styleguide](https://styleguide.vtex.com/).
