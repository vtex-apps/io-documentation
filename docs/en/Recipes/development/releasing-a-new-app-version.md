# Releasing a new app version

After you've finished developing your app, you may release it as the first step toward [making your new app version publicly available](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-making-your-new-app-version-publicly-available). The process of releasing an app consists of the following:

- Incrementing the app version in the `manifest.json` file according to the SemVer (semantic versioning) best practices.
- Updating the app's `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Creating a release commit and a release tag.
- Sending the performed changes to the app's repository.

Notice that releasing a new app version does not make it available to end-users, nor does it automatically update the app on accounts that have it installed. To do so, you must finish the entire process of [making your new app version publicly available](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-making-your-new-app-version-publicly-available).

## Before you start

If you are releasing an app on the [App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/), make sure that youâ€™ve covered [VTEX guidelines](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-homologation-requirements-for-vtex-app-store) before proceeding any further.

## Step by step

1. Open the terminal and log in to the account responsible for the app development, i.e., **the account specified as the app's vendor in the [`manifest.json`](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-manifest) file.**
2. Change to the app's root folder.
3. According to your scenario, run one of the following commands to release your new app version:

- `vtex release major stable` - Releases a **major** stable version.
- `vtex release minor stable` - Releases a **minor** stable version.
- `vtex release patch stable` - Release a **patch** stable version.

- `vtex release major beta` - Releases a **major** beta version.
- `vtex release minor beta` - Releases a **minor** beta version.
- `vtex release patch beta` - Releases a **patch** beta version.
