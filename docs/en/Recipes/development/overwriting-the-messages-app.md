# Overwriting the Messages app

## Introduction

Messages is VTEX IO's key tool for your store's **internationalization**, since it's responsible for translating any website message (that is, website text content) for rendering. 

However, you may feel that some translations done by the app are not what you want them to be. Therefore, you may want to change the translated content to something more specific or representative of your store, such as a special login message for Spanish speaking users from Argentina.

This recipe will show you how to overwrite the Messages app and easily create new message content through your store's admin.

## Step by step

1. [Install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) the `vtex.admin-graphql-ide@3.x` app using your terminal.

2. Access the **GraphQL admin IDE** section of the desired account. You may find it in the admin's side-bar menu:

3. From the dropdown list, choose the `vtex.messages` app.
4. Write the following mutation command in the text box that is displayed:

```graphql
mutation Save($saveArgs: SaveArgsV2!) {
  saveV2(args: $saveArgs)
}
```

5. Then, click on  **Query Variables** at the bottom of the page. Now, your screen may look like the following:

6. To fill in the "Query Variables" box, check the next sections **according to your store's desired scenario** (*catalog* or *app* messages translations).
7. After adjusting your query, click on the play button to run the declared mutation. For both scenarios, the expected response is as follows:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "saveV2": true
  }
}
```

Now, no other actions are needed on your part. Once you receive the expected response, you are ready to check out the desired changes in your store!

### Catalog translations

Use the following example as a guide if you aim to translate text messages from your store's catalog, such as a product name or a product description.

```json
{
  "saveArgs": {
    "to": "pt-BR",
    "messages": [
      {
        "srcLang": "en-US",
        "srcMessage": "Original name of the product in English",
        "context": "543123",
        "targetMessage": "Nome do produto em portuguÃªs"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**These variables are flexible and must fit your store's given scenario**. The variables for the store catalog translations are as follows:

- `to`: target translation locale.
- `messages`: a list of the messages you want to translate, containing the following parameters:
    - `srcLang`: source message locale.
    - `srcMessage`: source message string.
    - `context`: ID of the product/brand/category that you want to translate. IDs can be found in the admin under Product > Catalog.
    - `targetMessage`: translated message string.

### App messages translations

Use the following example as a guide if you aim to translate text messages exported from an app (declared in the app's `messages` folder).

```json
{
  "saveArgs": {
    "to": "en-US",
    "messages": [
      {
        "srcLang": "en-DV",
        "srcMessage": "store/search.placeholder",
        "context": "vtex.store-components@3.x",
        "targetMessage": "My personalized Search message"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**These variables are flexible and must match your store's desired scenario**. The variables for app message translations are as follows:

- `to`: target translation locale.
- `messages`: a list of the messages you want to translate, containing the following parameters:
    - `srcLang`: source message locale. This variable must contain the value `en-DV`, no matter which locale is rendered on the app's interface.
    - `srcMessage`: the `id` of your message string. The `id` related to a given string is declared in the app's `messages` folder.
    - `context`: the name of the app in which the message is being overwritten.
    - `targetMessage`: translated message string.
