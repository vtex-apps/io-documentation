#  Becoming a registered VTEX App Store developer

The [**VTEX App Store**](https://apps.vtex.com/) is a marketplace for VTEX IO plug-and-play solutions. 

As a developer, you can **share your own solutions** with other VTEX users in the [**VTEX App Store**](https://apps.vtex.com/) so they can also **leverage their business**. 

For that, you must register as a VTEX App Store seller by taking the following steps:

1. Express your interest to our team.
2. Sign our commercial agreement.
3. Register as a VTEX App Store seller.

##  Step by step

###  Step 1 - Expressing your interest

Fill out the [Application form](https://forms.gle/wpkXMxgSfCXwMPbs8) to **share your interest** in publishing your application or integration on the VTEX App Store.

The form will help our team to understand the best approach and prioritize the publication demands.

###  Step 2 - Signing our commercial agreement

If the form was correctly filled out and the team agrees that the application is suitable for the VTEX App Store, the next step is to sign a commercial agreement with VTEX.

This contract, provided by the VTEX team to you, will grant VTEX distribution rights over the app. In addition, it is going to sign your account up to the VTEX **Network Partner Program** if you are not already a member.

>ℹ️ The [Network Partner Program](https://network.vtex.com/terms_of_use) provides access to a VTEX account, allowing you to test and develop new apps and have access to tech support from the VTEX partner team.

### Step 3 - Registering as a VTEX App Store seller

The App Store is a **Marketplace**. Therefore, partners looking to distribute their apps should register as a  **seller** there. 

This [structure](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/configuring-the-marketplace-between-vtex-stores--tutorials_6520) (seller - marketplace) configuration is done through the `vtex.app-store-seller` app.
