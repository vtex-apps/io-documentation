# Marketing guidelines test

Once you have [developed your app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-developing-an-app), you have to prepare the App Page used to promote your app at the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/). The App Page is the first point of contact for retailers to learn more about your app and decide whether it is suitable for their business.

![appstore-page-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67270558/153282275-98bab015-81e8-4858-8538-72c9fa33d17e.gif)

Make sure to present your solutions professionally by adhering to the following principles:

- Clearly describe your app’s purpose and how merchants can benefit from it.
- Choose a product name that indicates the purpose of the app.
- Use high-quality images (icon and screenshots) and videos (if applicable).  


Note that if we see room for improvement, we’ll reach out to you before listing your app on the VTEX App Store. 

Refer to the following sections to improve your App Page and increase its adoption on the VTEX App Store.

> We recommend you follow these best practices while setting up the files that compose the marketing assets of an app. Please refer to [this guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-preparing-your-app-distribution#step-2---setting-the-public-folder) for more information.


## Tone & Voice
Choose to favor the Serious and Authority tones. We understand that they capture the reliability and expertise our system’s voice should have. 

| Tone and Voice | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Serious | Speak firmly, respectfully, and honestly - always with a more serious tone than playful. |
| Authority | Speak with mastery, proficiency, and expertise. |

To see more about VTEX’s tone and voice, go to [UX Writing Guidelines](https://uxwriting.vtex.com/docs/principles/goals-principles/#tone-and-voice) and [VTEX Brand Guide](https://brand.vtex.com/brand/voiceandtone) pages.

## Images
Images are a tool to express the visual identity of your app, make users learn more about the app, and reinforce your brand in the VTEX environment. The principles of a pack of images for the app are the following:

- Use high-quality images of your app’s UI to show the users how it behaves. 
- Add one icon that represents your app that will appear in search results, the first page of VTEX App Store, and the App’s page.
- Upload up to ten screenshots (app’s images) and a minimum of three.
- For storefront apps, combine Admin and storefront images to illustrate your app’s experience for both Merchant and Shopper.
- Add different mobile and desktop screenshots to improve the user experience depending on the screen.     


### Icon
Your app icon is one of the first elements of your app that developers and merchants see. It expresses the visual identity and reinforces your brand in the VTEX App Store environment.

![2-Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67270558/157433167-6118f67e-4042-40d8-bee3-e64ca5a65f12.png)

#### Do’s and Don’ts

- The icon must be in `PNG` format, a square image, without rounded corners.
- The icon must have a minimum resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels, a maximum resolution of 3000 x 3000 pixels, and a 1:1 ratio.
- The background of your icon must be transparent.
- The icon design must be simple and avoid unnecessary visual details. This will help merchants understand your app's purpose and have a better fit on smaller screens.
- The icon must not exceed 75% of the total space available of the icon size.

### Screenshots
Use screenshots to visually represent your app’s key features and purpose.

#### Do’s and Don’ts
- Provide three to five images showing the app on a Desktop and Mobile screen.
- Choose images of the app's interface and behavior, as well as the app's avaialble configurations on the Admin panel.
- Use the PNG format.
- The image’s size must be up to 700 x 400 pixels.
- Ensure text in your images is localized according to the app’s applicable market.
- Screenshots must highlight the purpose, actions and benefits of the app.
- Do not use images that reveal real usernames and accounts. Opt to take images with fictional or blurred information.
- Do not fully maximize the window when taking a screenshot. It can damage the quality of the image.

## Licenses
Licenses are written documents that contain the Terms and Conditions (T&C) of your app. They establish the direct business relationship between you, the developer, and the retailer that installs the app. 

### Do’s and Don’ts
 
- Seek legal advice for the writing of your T&C.
- Prepare a Personal Data Governance Program, which includes clauses in its T&C on the subject, depending on the applicable legislation, in addition to tools that allow data subjects to exercise their rights.
- Consider wording limiting liability clauses.
- Remember to cover Intellectual Property issues.
- Offer the T&C in your User’s language (Expected in English, Portuguese and Spanish).
- Analyze the consumer laws of the countries in which you operate, and offer consumers the rights provided.
- Review specific legislation related to your business, such as those issued by central banks if you are in financial services.
- Make it clear how you can hire your service: free, freemium, or premium, for example. Also, review the regulations regarding the payment methods you will accept.
