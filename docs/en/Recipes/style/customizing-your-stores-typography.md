# Customizing your store’s typography

## Introduction

In addition to being crucial for communicating with users, a store’s typography should be a reflection of its identity, using its characteristic styles, such as font size and spacing.

Using admin’s Storefront, you can customize a store’s typography faster and easier, without the need to resort to your theme’s code for direct CSS changes. 

## Step by step

1. Access **Styles** in the desired account’s admin, in **CMS**.
2. Select the More Options (three dots) menu for the store’s style whose typography will be edited.

3. Click on **Edit** and select **Typography**.

In the **Font Family** section, you can add a font family of your choosing in order to use in your store’s theme. Simply click on **Add custom font** and upload the desired font’s file.

After choosing the font family, you can apply it to your store’s text content. The **Type Token** option displays all your store’s text content that can be customized. In addition to each one’s font families, you can also customize other parameters, such as **Font Weight**, **Font Size**, capitalization (**Text Transform**) and spacing (**Letter Spacing**).
