# Managing URL Redirects
  
The **URL redirect** is very advantageous when you want a given web page's accesses to be redirected to another of your choosing. 

You may want to do this for any number of reasons, such as a change to the URL path or for users from a specific region to have access to a custom web page.

No matter the reason: it's likely that your website has already, is currently or will require a redirect from one URL to another.

Therefore, VTEX IO offers a fast and easy way to add, remove and manage your store's URL path redirects using Toolbelt, our CLI. Check it out:
  
## Step by step

### Adding redirects

1. Open a `.csv` file of your choosing. You can use Excel or Google sheets, for example;

<div class="alert alert-warning">
The file must be a <code>.csv</code> type file. Otherwise, the redirects upload will not work.
</div>

2. Once opened, create four columns in those files with the following values: `from`, `to`, `type` and `endDate`. For example:

![csv-file-url-redirect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52087100/78804703-dabb8880-7996-11ea-9fa6-2acd8766f67d.png)

| Property name | Description | Example |
|--|--|--|
| `from` | Original path, the path you want to create a redirect *from* | `/blouse/p` |
| `to` | New path or URL the one users will be redirected *to* | `/blouse/p?skuId=2000549` |
| `type` | The type of the redirect (`TEMPORARY` or `PERMANENT`) | `TEMPORARY` |
| `endDate` | Date, on the format `mm/dd/yyyy` at which the redirect will expire. Notice that if the redirect is permanent, no value for `endDate` is required. | `5/20/2020` |

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Only</strong> the <code>to</code> column accepts domains, such as <code>myotherstore.com</code> or <code>mystore.myvtex.com</code>. You should not use them in the <code>from</code> column. 
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<code>TEMPORARY</code> type redirects will receive the <code>302</code> status code, while <code>PERMANENT</code> type ones will receive the <code>301</code> status code.
</div>

3. Fill in the cells under each column with the values desired for your store. Remember that each redirect's data must be entered on different lines, as shown in the example below: 

![urls-redirect-csv-file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18706156/78902791-a3111700-7a50-11ea-8089-c4fe094a51fb.png)

4. Save and name the document as desired;
5. Using your terminal and the [VTEX IO Toolbelt](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-the-vtex-io-toolbelt/), log into your VTEX account;
6. Once logged in, run the `vtex redirects import {fileName}.csv`, replacing `{fileName}` with the name of the file that you've just saved.

After the sixth step, Toolbelt will receive the file, validate it, and save it. After that, the redirects will take effect.

### Removing redirects

1. Using your terminal and [VTEX IO Toolbelt](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-the-vtex-io-toolbelt/), log into your VTEX account;
2. Once logged in, run the `vtex redirects delete {path}`, replacing`{path}` with the URL path that will have its redirect removed.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
The path that is sent when running <code>vtex redirects delete {path}</code> will have its redirect removed, so it must be one of paths from the `from` column of the <code>.csv</code> type file.
</div>

### Verifying redirects

To check the site redirects that are saved on the platform's data bank, simply log into your VTEX account and run `vtex redirects export {fileName}.csv` , replacing `{fileName}` with the name of the `csv` file holding the site redirects. 

This will tell Toolbelt to return the full list of saved redirects to your local files.
