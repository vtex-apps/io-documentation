# Deactivating the VTEX IO native service worker

The VTEX IO platform provides a **native [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers)** to every store using VTEX Store Framework. 

This is due to the fact that all VTEX Store Framework stores natively benefit from having a **PWA** at their disposal. 

A PWA is a sort of web app used to promote certain advantageous features to users, such as offline navigation or a home screen icon. Once enabled in a store, the PWA uses the VTEX IO necessarily service worker in order to function. 

As a result of this native usage, you may face a conflict when working with a third party service responsible for providing its own service worker to operate. 
Since a website can only have one service worker running, you can **choose to deactivate the native service worker provided by VTEX IO in order to successfully use a third party solution in your store**. 

## Step by step

1. Access your account's admin.
2. Access CMS and then Store.
3. Click on the Advanced tab.
4. Toggle the Service Worker button.

5.  Save changes.

:information_source: *Notice that the toggle button can activate and deactivate the VTEX IO native service worker. Therefore, use the step by step above to manage it according to your store's needs.*

Once you save the changes, the VTEX Service Worker will be automatically disabled.
