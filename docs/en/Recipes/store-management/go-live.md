# Going live with Store Framework

If you have already set up your store's [commerce features](https://help.vtex.com/tracks) and built the storefront using [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-store-framework) it is time to go live.

This article will guide you through the steps you must take to make your ecommerce available to online shoppers.

## Go live scenarios

When it comes to the VTEX ecosystem, there are a few different scenarios in which you may wish to launch a new store or storefront.

If you are Launching a new store built with Store Framework or migrating from another ecommerce platform, follow the [instructions below](#step-by-step).

If you already have an active VTEX store running the [Legacy CMS Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj) and wish to migrate your storefront to Store Framework, see the guide on [migrating from Legacy CMS Portal to Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-migrating-storefront-from-legacy-to-io).

We do not recommend launching a new VTEX store using [Legacy CMS Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj). However, if that is your case, see this article on [setting up DNS pointing](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-dns-pointing-to-vtex). Consider [migrating to Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-migrating-storefront-from-legacy-to-io).
