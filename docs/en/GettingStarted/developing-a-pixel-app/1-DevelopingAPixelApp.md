# Developing a Pixel app

Several [Pixel apps](https://vtex.io/docs/concepts/pixel-app) are already available through VTEX Store Framework, ensuring that your store has the means to natively integrate with the main third party solutions available on the market. 

It is possible, however, that the integration you’re looking for is not currently available on the pixel apps list that are ready to be installed. In such cases, you should **create your desired integration from scratch**.

In the following steps of this track, you will learn all the necessary steps to leverage from the new integration, thereby **developing a Pixel app according to your store's own needs**. 

> ℹ️ *If you’re unsure whether to proceed with developing a pixel app or to customize an HTML tag using GTM, keep in mind that the first option is always the most recommended. Developing an new app will enable a bold integration process with a third party solution, in addition to further evolving the Framework to help other users that may be interested in the same integration.*
